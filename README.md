# LinksFilter
Use this script to remove links you don't want from a large links file, this script is a part from one of my private scraping bots that I can't share here, but this script can work as independent script.

# Requirements:
1. Python 3.x.

# How to use this ?
1. Make sure you have Python installed.
2. You need 3 txt files. one named "Links_to_Filter.txt" the other "All_Links.txt" and the third "Filtered_links.txt".
3. Add your links to All_Links.txt file, make sure to add every link at a single line.
4. Add links you want to remove from the AllLinks to the "Links_to_Filter.txt", make sure to add every link at a single line.
5. Run the script and it will filter and remove the links you don't want from the All_Links.
6. After the run is complete check the Filtered_links.txt file you will find the final result there.
